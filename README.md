# Introduction

Global Travel Finder is an easy-to-use web application designed to help users discover the best travel destinations based on their preferences. Whether youâ€™re looking for adventure, relaxation, or cultural experiences, this app provides personalized travel suggestions to make your next trip memorable.

## Problem statement

Travel enthusiasts often struggle to find destinations that align with their specific interests, whether for a relaxing getaway, an adventurous trip, or a cultural exploration. With so many places to visit around the world, it can be
